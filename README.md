Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a PhD student in the Unit of Structural Engineering and Design in the Department of the Built Environment at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). My research focuses on additive manufacturing of functional materials on demand. Here on my GitHub profile, and through our [3DCP TU/e](https://github.com/3DCP-TUe) group organization, I aim to share as much of my work as possible. Besides, outside my academic work, I am also a developer and maintainer of the Grasshopper plugin [Robot Components](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents) in my spare time.
