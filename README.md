Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a PhD student in the Unit of Structural Engineering and Design in the Department of the Built Environment at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). My research focuses on additive manufacturing of functional materials on demand. Here on my GitHub profile, and through our 3DCP TU/e group organization, I aim to share as much of my work as possible.
